# How to Scope the Game

Start by opening the float form and let it guide you!


The industry scoping section will give you some guidance to the most popular sectors on what to think about when choosing or creating a scenario for the sector your organization belongs to. Following this is not obligatory, but recommended if you are new to the game and want some pointers.

All gamescenario templates are found under the Game Templates section.


Enjoy Scoping!
