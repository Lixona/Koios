# Game Templates
This section contains the game templates for the character sheet and some pre-made scenarios. The original files for these that you can edit to your liking, or create a scenario of your own, is found under "Editable Templates".

To see how a character sheet is filled out, see the master guide and check under the "Examples" folder for some pre-filled out templates.
