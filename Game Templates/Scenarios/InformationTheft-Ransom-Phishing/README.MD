# Scenario Rundown

This Scenario Contains an incident where someones user credentials has been used to access a system at odd times. Data is gone, and it doesn't take long before the director gets a ransom email stating that information will be disclosed if they are not paid. Regardless, data is leaked and it is now up to the awesome team of incident handlers to deal with stressed out customers/clients, media, legalities of losing the data, and an overworked 1st line.
But wait... another user has also been accessed! - Seems like the common denominator is a phish email they both got last week. 
The Incident responders need to deal with several elements related to how to deal with both the remediation process of stolen data and credentials and the media.
