# This section contains different pre-made scenarios

You can choose one at random, or follow the inustry scoping guidance and pick one that applies to your industry sector.
The choice is yours.

If you want to create your own from scratch, check out the "Editable Templates" under the "Game Templates" folder. Here you will find the original files/empty templates for both the charachter sheet and scenario building. 

Remember that every scenario has two files. One that can be presented to the players, and one that is used as a guidance for the game master. 



Immerse yourself!



NOTE: There are not many pre-made scenarios created yet since this is mainl a proof of concept for my bachelor. Maybe more will be added in the future. Time will tell!
