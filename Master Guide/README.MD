# Master Guide

It is strongly adviced to read all of this before playing.

Question: Why isn't the an editable Master Guide here since all the other sections have editable templates?

Answer: Because it will be confusing if everyone creates their own flavor of the Master guide with the same layout and starts to spread that. If you want to tweak the whole game and make it public, attribute the sections you copy and make your own design and cool name. - And then send me a message cause I would love to see how it evolves in other peoples brilliant minds!
