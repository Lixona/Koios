# Review Phase

The review phase is three-fold. More details about this phase can be found in the master guide.

It contains the following phases:

*Phase 1: Gameplay review.- This is where you review the events and what can be changed.
*Phase 2: Communication and teamwork review. - This is where you review the communication and teamwork in the group.
*Phase 3: Feedback form for the game. - This is where you can get som feedback from the players about the simulation.


While it is posible to tweak and adapt your own review phase, it is reccomended to atleast keep these 3 phases so you can review the different aspects of the simulation. The questions within the phases can be changed to better suit your organization.
